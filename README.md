## Hydroponic Setup

Tomatoes are grown in buckets with clay pellets and circulating nutrient solution.  
The system tracks and logs:

- water temperature  
- pH level  
- EC (nutrient concentration)  
- room temperature  
- humidity  
- CO₂  
- light levels  

pH and EC are regulated through external controllers, while the rest feeds into the monitoring system.

## Music

Most important component here is the speaker obviously —  
Drum and bass allegedly increases tomato size 10×
